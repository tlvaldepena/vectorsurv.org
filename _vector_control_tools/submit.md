As a service to the vector control community, VectorSurv maintains and provides a list of tools which may be of value to the vector control community. [View the list](.).

## How to submit your tool
If you have a tool that you believe would be useful to the vector control community, please send an email to [help@vectorsurv.org](mailto:help@vectorsurv.org?subject=Submit a vector control tool) with the following information:
-	Name of your tool
-	Description (text only)
-	Developer name
-	Developer email address (so that we can contact the developer with any questions)
-	Desired image as a .png or .jpg with an aspect ratio of 16:9. 


We recommend that you create and maintain documentation for users that is linked from the tool itself and provide a way for users to contact you to ask questions or get support if needed.

## Requirements
We will consider including tools that:
1.	are free of charge and not require any services that require a fee.
2.	Provide significant value to individuals in the public health and / or vector control community
3.	are maintained to ensure correct behavior. A tool that has known issues that are not corrected may be removed from the list. 

VectorSurv reserves the right to accept, reject, review, or remove any listing for any reason and at any time without notice or explanation.
