title: VectorSurv Accessibility
---

At VectorSurv we aim to develop applications and web content that are accessible to everyone. We strive to meet the accessibility guidelines identified in the [UC Information Technology Accessibility policy](http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/7000611/IMT-1300) and [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). 

We are continually working to improve the experience of everyone who uses VectorSurv tools including:
- VectorSurv Gateway, including all state-specific variants (e.g., CalSurv, UtahSurv, JerseySurv, etc.)
- VectorSurv Maps
- VectorSurv OpenData
- Vectorsurv.org (this website)

If you encounter an issue accessing any VectorSurv content or have any questions regarding the accessibility of our applications, please let us know by sending an email to [help@vectorsurv.org](mailto:help@vectorsurv.org).
