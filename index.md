Welcome to the Vectorborne Disease Surveillance System, known as VectorSurv.

VectorSurv is a web-based platform for data managemeent and analysis that is used by vector control and public health agencies in the U.S. The system was initiated in 2006 as a partnership of the Mosquito and Vector Control Association of California, representing more than 60 local mosquito and vector control agencies in California; the California Department of Public Health; and the Davis Arbovirus Research and Training (DART) Lab at the University of California, Davis.

Beginning in 2017, VectorSurv has expanded to include other states, and the system now serves a growing number of U.S. states and US-Affiliated Pacific Islands (see list below).

Much of the data in VectorSurv can be visualized on our mapping website, **VectorSurv Maps** ([https://maps.vectorsurv.org](https://maps.vectorsurv.org)). This website shows past and present results of surveillance for arboviruses, including West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis virus, and the spread of the invasive mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Aedes notoscriptus.

Mosquito control and public health agencies who use the VectorSurv system do so through the **VectorSurv Gateway** ([https://gateway.vectorsurv.org](https://gateway.vectorsurv.org)), which is an online interface for managing, and analyzing surveillance and control data related to mosquitoes and arboviruses. The Gateway requires login credentials for each user, who must belong to an identified agency. Each agency maintains all privileges to manage its own data and user accounts, and higher-level aggregate reporting functions are managed by states, including reporting to [CDC's ArboNet](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/arbonet/maps/ADB_Diseases_Map/index.html) national database.

Surveillance reports and other information are available available through partner websites in each state, and national maps of arbovirus surveillance results are available from CDC’s ArboNet system. To access this information, select from the links below.
