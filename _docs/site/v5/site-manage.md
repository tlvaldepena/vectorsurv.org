## Site Management Table

**Filter By:**

- **All** retrieves all records.

- **Date** lets you select a custom timeframe to search for records.

  - Select the timeframe for which you wish to view sites by
    choosing the appropriate values using the start and end
    datepickers. You can type a date value in the format set under
    [Account
    Preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/account-preferences)
    or pick a date using the datepicker UI. The \# column on the
    left with the gray boxes represent disease weeks. Clicking on a
    disease week number will autopopulate the start/end inputs with
    the appropriate values for that disease week.

The table is sorted by site code, deactive date then id, but you can sort the table by any field by clicking on
the column name.

Beneath the table, you can navigate between pages using the
arrows or clicking on a page number. You can also change how
many sites to display on a single page using the
**Items/page** dropdown option.

You can also use the search box on the right to filter results by site
code, site ID or other keywords. Clicking the X button will remove
the search filter and display the entire table.

**Action Buttons:**

filled-in site form where you can modify the fields as
necessary.

option is unavailable if there are any records linked to this site.

![Create site revision](/assets/images/docs/action-button-site-revision.png): Quick link to create a new site revision based on the selected site. This option is only available if the site has a set active or deactive date.
