  Click the **Add Bands** link to add new Band IDs to your agency. This will pull up a pop-up box prompting you to enter new Band ID values. You can use both boxes to enter a range of numbers or enter individual numbers using either box. Click the **Add Bands** button to add the new Band IDs to the **Available Column** or the **Close** button if you don't wish to make any changes. You will not be able to enter a Band ID that is already in use for a particular year. Note that new Band IDs are not automatically added to the flock.
