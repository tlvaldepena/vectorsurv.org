## Fields

- **Year**: Choose the year that the new flock will be active using the drop-down arrow.
- **Flocks at Site**: The [site]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/site/) where this flock is located. Select from previously saved sites using the drop-down arrow. Each site can only be associated with one flock per surveillance year.
- **Bands**: These are the wing band numbers for the individual chickens placed in this flock. Select band numbers by clicking on the numbers under the **Available** column. Selected values will be highlighted in blue. Multiple values can be selected by using _CTRL/CMD/SHIFT_ keys while selecting values. Click on the **>>** button to move selected sites to the **Selected** column. You can remove sites from the **Selected** column in the same way by clicking on the **<<** button to move them back to the **Available** column.

  Click the **Add Bands** link to add new Band IDs to your agency. This will pull up a pop-up box prompting you to enter new Band ID values. You can use both boxes to enter a range of numbers or enter individual numbers using either box. Click the **Add Bands** button to add the new Band IDs to the **Available Column** or the **Close** button if you don't wish to make any changes. You will not be able to enter a Band ID that is already in use for a particular year. Note that new Band IDs are not automatically added to the flock.
