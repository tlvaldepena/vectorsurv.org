# Source Configuration

Sources allow you to bookmark locations that are regularly treated, saving time by eliminating the need to re-enter geographic information for every [new application]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/application/v5/application).

- **Source Code**: A unique 10-digit numeric identifier for the source.
  - Codes must be unique within your agency.
  - To help you choose, a list of **Available Source Codes** is provided on the right-hand side of the screen.

- **Source Name**: (Recommended) A descriptive name to help identify the location easily. Both the **Source Code** and **Source Name** are searchable and will autocomplete on data entry pages.
- **Address**: The specific address or nearest intersection to the source.
- **Waters of the US**: Check this box if the source is classified as a "Waters of the US" location.
  - **Affected Waters**: This field appears only when _Waters of the US_ is selected. Use it to record the names of any affected water bodies.
- **Comments**: Any additional notes or specific instructions to be recorded with this source.
- **Source Shape**: Define the spatial location of the source using the map interface:
  - **Geocoding**: Use the address geolocation field on the right side of the map to automatically plot the point.
  - **Drawing Tools**: Manually create a point, polygon, or line directly on the map. **Double-click** on an existing polygon or line to enter **Editing Mode** and adjust the shape.
  - **Map Layers**: Toggle between **Street** or **Satellite** views to assist with precise placement.
  - **Recenter**: Click the blue **Recenter** icon ![Recenter Button]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/docs/recenter-btn.png) in the lower right-hand corner of the map to pan the view back to the defined source.
