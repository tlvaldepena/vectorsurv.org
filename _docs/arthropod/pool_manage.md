View and edit saved pools.

## Pool Management Table

Select the month and year for which you wish to view [pools]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/pool) by choosing the appropriate values using the drop-down arrows. Click the **Change Month/Year** button to make the change.

There are summary boxes on the right-hand side of the screen describing the pools for the current month by species and by arbovirus results. There is also an option to auto-create printed labels for specific pools by clicking the link and entering the pool numbers to include. The settings for creating labels can be managed under [Account Preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/account-preferences).
