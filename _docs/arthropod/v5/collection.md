Collections are the records of arthropod population data through the
placement of traps.

## Date
Date format is based on the settings under [Account
Preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/account-preferences).

**Input by start/end dates:** There are two ways to input the collection date. You can choose your preferred method by clicking on the toggle button that says "Input by start/end dates".

- **Off(default):** Enter a single collection date and number of nights the trap was in
  the field. The collection date is the date the trap was picked up.
  The start date for the trap will be calculated by subtracting the
  trap nights from the provided collection date. A trap placed and
  collected on the next day would be 1 trap night. Because the minimum
  is 1 night, if a trap was placed and collected on the same day,
  enter 1.

- **On:** Enter collection start and end dates. The trap nights field will be
  automatically calculated based on the provided dates and cannot be
  edited by the user.

**Timezone:** Displays the current timezone. Click on it to open a modal where you can select a custom timezone.

**Collection Date** or **Collection End Date**: The date the trap
  was picked up / last day of the collection. You can type a date
  value in the format set under [Account
  Preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/account-preferences)
  or pick a date using the datepicker UI. The \# column on the left
  with the gray boxes represent disease weeks. These are for
  reference-only and cannot be selected.

**Collection Start Date:** The date the trap was set up / the
  collection was started. You can type a date value in the format set
  under [Account
  Preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/account-preferences)
  or pick a date using the datepicker UI. The \# column on the left
  with the gray boxes represent disease weeks. These are for
  reference-only and cannot be selected.

**Trap Nights**: Number of nights the trap was in the field. Minimum
  is 1 night. If a trap was placed and collected on the same day,
  enter 1.

## Site

The [site]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/site/) where a trap was placed. A
collection date needs to be selected before you can choose a trap site.

**Site Code**: Start typing in any part of the site code or name and
  the dropdown will filter the sites to that text. Selecting a site
  code from the dropdown select will place a blue marker on the map.
  You can also select a site using the 'Show Existing Sites' toggle in
  the Map section.

**Precision:** Used to specify the level of certainty in the site
  coordinate. In most cases, this field should be kept as Exact. For
  historical data, instances where the exact location is uncertain or
  in instances where the exact location need to be obscured due to
  human case privacy concerns, the user may choose the most accurate
  option from the list.

## Map
  Clicking on the "Map" heading will expand the map panel to
  give a view of the site area. Once a site is selected, the trap can
  be dragged to a new location up to 400m away indicated by the
  circle.

![Site Map Card](/assets/images/docs/site-map.png)

**Zero Site Code**: Collections using the Zero Code will have no
    buffer zone and can be placed anywhere on the map. You can read
    more about Zero Site Codes in the [Site
    documentation.]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/site/v5/new-site)

**Latitude and Longitude:** These fields will be automatically
    populated once a site is selected, and they can be adjusted with
    the same 400m limitation mentioned above.

**Latitude:** The latitude value. Must be between -90 & 90 degrees.

**Longitude:** The longitude value. Must be between -180 & 180
  degrees.

The user can make the map zoom in and out using the "+/-"
    buttons in the upper left hand corner, or by scrolling while
    hovering over the map.

The "Show Existing sites" toggle will add gray markers for other
    existing sites to the map You can click on a site to see the
    site details and select 'Set As Site' to select it as the
    collection's trap site. Clicking the blue "recenter" icon in the
    lower right-hand corner of the map will cause the map view to
    pan over to the current site marker.


## Trap Details
**Trap**: The type of trap placed in the field. The list of traps in
  the dropdown can be adjusted through the Trap Types settings on the
  [arthropod configuration
  page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/trap-types/).

**Lure(s)**: The types of lure(s) used with the trap if any.
  *Unspecified* and *None* can only be selected individually.

**\# of Traps**: The number of unique traps in operation at one
  site.

**Identified By**: The person who identified the arthropods in this
  trap.

**Trap had problems?**: If checked, the trap used for this
  collection is considered to have experienced any mechanical
  failures, i.e. fan broke, dead battery, etc. Leave unchecked if the
  trap did not experience a problem during the trapping period.

## Comment

Use this section to note anything other users should know about the
collection, including the reason(s) for trap failure, for example.

## Species Count {#species-count}

Use this section to enter arthropods found in the trap. Once a species
has been added to the collection, it will appear in the table below.

**Ticks:** Use the [tick
module]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tick/tick-menu/) if entering a tick
collection. Historical data where a tick species was entered under an
arthropod collection may be viewed here but not edited. A link to the
legacy form is provided in case you need to edit the data.

### Input Methods:

You will see a single mobile-friendly form if your screen size is smaller than 768px. If your screen size is larger than 768px, there you will see two input methods: A tabular input similar to the legacy form where you can update multiple abundances in one go and the mobile-friendly form where you can input one abundance at a time. Switching between forms will discard any edits you made to the current form. Changing screen size will affect which input methods are available unless there are live edits that have not been saved. Once you have cleared or saved your edits, the input methods will respond to the new screen size. The input style will remember the last selection you made (eg: If you selected Form Input, it will always load on Form Input until you select Tabular Input, then it will always load the Tabular Input first.)

#### Tabular Input

  ![Tabular Input](/assets/images/docs/new_collection_tabular.png)

  - Note: Edits made in the tabular input (including clicking the X to remove a row) are not saved until you click the Save Changes button.
  - To enter an abundance first select the species that make up this abundance. Start typing to filter the list. Each row must have a unique species not already entered for this collection. The list of species in the dropdown can be adjusted through the Available Species settings on the [arthropod configuration page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/trap-types/).
  - When you select a species a new unpopulated row will automatically appear. This is for convenience so the user does not have to manually create each new row. This will not create a new empty abundance.
  - After a species is selected, you can input counts for each sex/stage/condition column. ‘Σ F’ represents the total number of females for the row’s species across F-Mixed, F-Unfed, F-Bloodfed and F-Gravid. Each row must have at least one count. It is not necessary to mark 0 counts as that is assumed when left blank or absent from the form.
    - You can enter either F-Mixed OR any combination of F-Unfed, F-Bloodfed and F-Gravid. For example, if you input a count for F-Bloodfed, the F-Mixed input will become disabled. If you input a count for F-Mixed, F-Unfed, F-Bloodfed and F-Gravid will all be disabled.
  - The bottom row represents totals for each sex/stage/condition across species.
  - **Action Buttons:**
    ![Gray X icon](/assets/images/docs/action-button-remove.png) Remove the selected row.

#### Form Input

  ![Species Form Input](/assets/images/docs/new_collection_species_form.png)

**Species**: The species that make up this abundance. Start typing
    to filter the list. The list of species in the dropdown can be
    adjusted through the Available Species settings on the [arthropod
    configuration
    page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/trap-types/).

**Sex/Condition**: The sex/condition/life stage of the abundance.
    Start typing to filter the list.

**Count:** Number of specimens in the abundance. Minimum of 1.

### Abundance Table:

**Action buttons**:

  ![Pencil icon](/assets/images/docs/action-button-edit.png): Edit the selected abundance. The
  abundance information will populate in the form and will no longer be
  viewable in the table. (The data is only moved locally -- if you do not
  finish editing the form or there are technical issues the abundance data
  will still be saved on the collection.)

  ![Red trash can icon](/assets/images/docs/action-button-delete.png): Delete the selected abundance.

  ![Go to legacy site](/assets/images/docs/action-button-legacy-link.png): Return to the legacy form to edit a
  tick abundance.

**Totals**:

  - Total females: Total number of female specimen across all abundances
    in the table.

  - Total: Total number of specimen of any sex across all abundances in
    the table.

## Pool

Optionally, a pool for arbovirus testing can be entered or linked
through the collection page. This links the pool to the collection that
the pool originated from.

### Generate Pool(s):

Use this form to enter new pool(s) linked to this collection or edit
existing pools linked to this collection.

**Pool Number**: A numeric identifier for the pool. Pool numbers
  have to be unique per agency per year. Normally you would start at 1
  and increment throughout the year but the exact numbering scheme is
  up to you. Available numbers for your agency are shown in the aside
  menu on the righthand side of the page. Open the orange Pool \#
  Availability card. You can open and close the menu using the small
  arrow tab on the far-right edge of the page.

![Collection Form Aside Menu](/assets/images/docs/aside-collection-form.png)

**Method:** The list of traps in the dropdown can be adjusted
  through the Trap Types settings on the [arthropod configuration
  page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/trap-types/).

**Species:** The species that make up this pool. Start typing to
  filter the list. The list of species in the dropdown can be adjusted
  through the Available Species settings on the [arthropod
  configuration
  page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/trap-types/).

**Sex/Condition:** The sex/condition/life stage of the arthropods in
  this pool.

**Comments:** Any accompanying comments.

**Count/Count per Pool:** The total number of specimens in this
  pool/each pool (if generating batches of more than one pool). If
  this pool has specimens from more than one site, the number of
  specimens from the primary site (**Site Code** column) will be
  determined from this value.

**\# of Pools:** The number of pools to generate. This field only
  appears when creating new pool(s).

**Secondary Sites:** If this pool has specimens from more than one
  site, a view-only table will appear in the form that lists the
  secondary sites and count (if any) for each site. You may return to
  the legacy form if you wish to edit any of these secondary sites.

### Link Existing Pools:

A table of pools eligible to be linked to the current collection. You
can click on the link button to the right of a pool to link a pool to
the collection. Linking a pool will overwrite the **collection date**,
**site, lures** and **trap** values with those of the collection. It
will also remove any **secondary sites** associated with the pool.

**Linked Pools Table:**

A list of all pools linked to the current collection. If a pool has a
positive test result, the Positive? column will show an abbreviation in
red of what it was positive for.

Action buttons:

  ![Pencil icon](/assets/images/docs/action-button-edit.png): Edit the selected pool. The pool
  information will populate in the form and will no longer be viewable in
  the table. (The data is only moved locally -- if you do not finish
  editing the form or there are technical issues, the abundance data will
  still be saved on the collection.)

  ![Unlink icon](/assets/images/docs/action-button-unlink.png): Unlink the selected pool. This will
  remove the link between the pool and the collection.

  ![Red trash can icon](/assets/images/docs/action-button-delete.png): Delete the selected pool.

**Total Count:** Total number of specimen across all pools the table.

**Total Pools:** Total number of pools linked to the collection.
