Pool submissions are records of groups of mosquitoes sent to be tested
for arboviruses.

This page serves the same purpose as the optional pool entry form on the
new collection page. Pools entered here can be linked back to a specific
collection from the [Collection
Management]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/v5/collection-manage/)
page. One or the other should be used to submit a single pool.

## Form Fields

**Collection Date**: The date the trap was picked up / last day of
  the collection. You can type a date value in the format set under
  [Account
  Preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/account-preferences)
  or pick a date using the datepicker UI.

**Pool Number:** A numeric identifier for the pool. A collection
  date needs to be selected before you can choose a pool number. Pool
  numbers must be unique per agency per year. Normally you would start
  at 1 and increment throughout the year but the exact numbering
  scheme is up to you. Available numbers for your agency are shown in
  the aside menu on the righthand side of the page. Open the orange
  Pool \# Availability card. You can open and close the menu using the
  small arrow tab on the far-right edge of the page.

**Method**: The type of trap placed in the field. The list of traps
  in the dropdown can be adjusted through the Trap Types settings on
  the [arthropod configuration
  page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/trap-types/).

**Site Code**: The [site]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/site/) where a
  trap was placed. A collection date needs to be selected before you
  can choose a trap site. Start typing in any part of the site code or
  name and the dropdown will filter the sites to that text. Selecting
  a site code from the dropdown select will place a blue marker on the
  map. You can also select a site using the 'Show Existing Sites'
  toggle in the Map section.

**Precision**: Used to specify the level of certainty in the site
  coordinate. In most cases, this field should be kept as Exact. For
  historical data, instances where the exact location is uncertain or
  in instances where the exact location need to be obscured due to
  human case privacy concerns, the user may choose the most accurate
  option from the list.

**Map**: Clicking on the "Map" heading will expand the map panel to
  give a view of the site area. Once a site is selected, the trap can
  be dragged to a new location up to 400m away indicated by the circle

  - **Zero Site Code**: Collections using the Zero Code will have no
    buffer zone and can be placed anywhere on the map. You can read
    more about Zero Site Codes in the [Site
    documentation.]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/site/)

  - **Latitude and Longitude:** These fields will be automatically
    populated once a site is selected, and they can be adjusted with
    the same 400m limitation mentioned above.

  - The user can make the map zoom in and out using the "+/-"
    buttons in the upper left hand corner, or by scrolling while
    hovering over the map.

  - The "Show Existing sites" toggle will add gray markers for other
    existing sites to the map You can click on a site to see the
    site details and select 'Set As Site' to select it as the
    collection's trap site. Clicking the blue "recenter" icon in the
    lower right-hand corner of the map will cause the map view to
    pan over to the current site marker.

![Site Map Card](/assets/images/docs/site-map.png)

**Latitude:** The latitude value. Must be between -90 & 90 degrees.

**Longitude:** The longitude value. Must be between -180 & 180
  degrees.

**Species:** The species that make up this pool. Start typing to
  filter the list. The list of species in the dropdown can be adjusted
  through the Available Species settings on the [arthropod
  configuration
  page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/trap-types/).

**Sex/Condition**: The sex/condition/life stage of the arthropods in
  this pool. Start typing to filter the list.

**Lure(s)**: The types of lure(s) used with the trap if any.
  *Unspecified* and *None* can only be selected individually.

**Comments**: Any accompanying comments.

**Linked Collection**: Click the blue link button to get a list of
  collections eligible for linking.

  - **Action Buttons:**  
    ![Link icon](/assets/images/docs/action-button-link.png): Link the pool to the selected collection. The pool's **collection date**, **site, lures** and
    **trap** values will be overwritten by those of the selected
    collection. It will also remove any **secondary sites** associated
    with the pool. You may only link to one collection per pool.

    ![Unlink icon](/assets/images/docs/action-button-unlink.png): Indicates pool is currently linked to
    this collection. Clicking on this will unlink the pool.

    ![Collapsible arrow icon](/assets/images/docs/action-button-expand.png):
    Opens subtable to view species details.

**Count/Count per Pool**: The total number of specimens in this
  pool/each pool (if generating batches of more than one pool). If
  this pool has specimens from more than one site, the number of
  specimens from the primary site (**Site Code** column) will be
  determined from this value.

**\# of Pools:** The number of pools to generate. This field only
  appears when creating new pool(s).

**Secondary Sites:** If this pool has specimens from more than one
  site, a view-only table will appear in the form that lists the
  secondary sites and count (if any) for each site. You may return to
  the legacy form if you wish to edit any of these secondary sites.

## Manage Mosquito Pools Table

**Filter By:**

- **Date** lets you select a custom timeframe to search for records.

  - Select the timeframe for which you wish to view collections by
    choosing the appropriate values using the start and end
    datepickers. You can type a date value in the format set under
    [Account
    Preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/account-preferences)
    or pick a date using the datepicker UI. The \# column on the
    left with the gray boxes represent disease weeks. Clicking on a
    disease week number will autopopulate the start/end inputs with
    the appropriate values for that disease week. The table is
    sorted by most recent collection date then collection number by
    default, but you can sort the table by any field by clicking on
    the column name.

  - Beneath the table, you can navigate between pages using the
    arrows or clicking on a page number. You can also change how
    many collections to display on a single page using the
    **Items/page** dropdown option. The table is sorted by most
    recently updated pool by default, but you can sort the table by
    any field by clicking on the column name.

- **Recent** displays the most recent records to view. The default is
  10, but you can use the dropdown to change the number of records to
  display. The table is sorted by most recently updated record then by
  collection number by default, but you can sort the table by any
  field by clicking on the column name.

You can also use the search box on the right to filter results by site
code, pool \# or other keywords. Clicking the X button will remove the
search filter and display the entire table.
