Submit saved pools to be tested for the presence of arboviruses.

**Select a lab**: Choose whether the pool(s) will be sent to a central laboratory (i.e. DART in California) for testing or if the testing will be conducted in-house. You also have the option to change the [default]({{ site.baseur1 }}/docs/arthropod/trap-types) lab for testing.

**Select pools**: All [saved pools]({{ site.baseur1 }}/docs/arthropod/pool) from the selected time period will be displayed on the table. Use the **Include** checkbox to indicate which pool(s) to group for submission for testing. Click the **Create New Submission** button to add the selected pool(s) to the submission. The **Remove from Queue** button prevents checked pool(s) from being included in future submissions or being added to [existing submissions]({{ site.baseur1 }}/docs/arthropod/submission-manage).
