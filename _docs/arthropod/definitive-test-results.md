title: Definitive Test Results
---

When a specimen pool is tested multiple times for the same pathogen, our system automatically determines which result to use as the definitive (final) result.

## Resolution Process

We use the following priority rules to select the definitive result:

### 1. Test Method Sensitivity (Highest Priority)

The result from the **most sensitive testing method** is considered definitive.

_Example: If a pool was tested using both RT-PCR (high sensitivity) and RAMP (lower sensitivity), the RT-PCR result would be used._

### 2. Most Recent Test Date

If multiple tests used methods with **equal sensitivity**, the **most recently performed test** is considered definitive.

_Example: If a pool was tested twice using RT-PCR—once in January and once in March—the March result would be used._

### 3. Most Recent System Entry

If tests were performed on the **same date**, the result that was **most recently added to the system** is considered definitive.

_Example: If two RT-PCR tests were both performed on April 15th, but one was entered into the system on April 16th and another on April 20th, the April 20th entry would be used._

## Important Notes

### Result Types Considered

Under most circumstances, only **definitive results** are included in this resolution process:

- **Confirmed/Positive**
- **Negative**
- **Presumptive** (in certain states)

The following result types are considered inconclusive and are **not** considered when determining the definitive result:

- Inconclusive
- Other
- Pending

## Why This Matters

This automated process ensures that:

- You always see the most accurate and reliable test result
- Results from more sensitive methods take precedence
- The most up-to-date information is prioritized
- Consistency is maintained across all test records
