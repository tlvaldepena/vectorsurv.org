Collections are the records of tick population data through manual
collection methods or the placement of traps.

## Date

Date format is based on the settings under [Account
Preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/account-preferences).

**Spans 2 days or more**: Leave this toggle off if the collection
  was set and collected within the same day. Turn this toggle on if
  the collection was set and collected on different days. You should
  see two collection date inputs, one for the start date and one for
  the end date.

  - **Collection Date** or **Collection End Date**: The date the
    trap was picked up / last day of the collection. You can type a
    date value in the format set under [Account
    Preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/account-preferences)
    or pick a date using the datepicker UI. The \# column on the
    left with the gray boxes represent disease weeks. These are for
    reference-only and cannot be selected.

  - **Collection Start Date:** The date the trap was set up / the
    collection was started. You can type a date value in the format
    set under [Account
    Preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/account-preferences)
    or pick a date using the datepicker UI. The \# column on the
    left with the gray boxes represent disease weeks. These are for
    reference-only and cannot be selected.

**Date Only**: Leave this toggle off if you have start and end times
  to log. Turn it on if you only have dates.

  - **Start time**: You can type specific times or use the dropdown
    select to pick times by 15 minute increments.

  - **End time**: You can type specific times or use the dropdown
    select to pick times by 15 minute increments.

**Timezone:** Displays the current timezone. Click on it to open a
  modal where you can select a custom timezone.

## Site

The [site]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/site/) where a trap was placed. A
collection date needs to be selected before you can choose a trap site.

**Site Code**: Start typing in any part of the site code or name and
  the dropdown will filter the sites to that text. Selecting a site
  code from the dropdown select will place a blue marker on the map.
  You can also select a site using the 'Show Existing Sites' toggle in
  the Map section.

**Map**: Clicking on the "Map" heading will expand the map panel to
  give a view of the site area. Once a site is selected, the trap can
  be dragged to a new location up to 400m away indicated by the
  circle.

  - **Zero Site Code**: Collections using the Zero Code will have no
    buffer zone and can be placed anywhere on the map. You can read
    more about Zero Site Codes in the [Site
    documentation.]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/site/v5/new-site)

  - **Latitude and Longitude**: These fields will be automatically
    populated once a site is selected, and they can be adjusted with
    the same 400m limitation mentioned above.

  - The user can make the map zoom in and out using the "+/-"
    buttons in the upper left hand corner, or by scrolling while
    hovering over the map.

  - The "Show Existing sites" toggle will add gray markers for other
    existing sites to the map You can click on a site to see the
    site details and select 'Set As Site' to select it as the
    collection's trap site. Clicking the blue "recenter" icon in the
    lower right-hand corner of the map will cause the map view to
    pan over to the current site marker.

**Longitude:** The longitude value. Must be between -180 & 180

**Precision:** Used to specify the level of certainty in the site
  coordinate. In most cases, this field should be kept as Exact. For
  historical data, instances where the exact location is uncertain or
  in instances where the exact location need to be obscured due to
  human case privacy concerns, the user may choose the most accurate
  option from the list.

## Species Count

Use this section to enter ticks in the collection. Once a species has
been added to the collection, it will appear in the table below.

**Species**: The species that make up this abundance. Start typing

  adjusted through the Available Species settings on the [arthropod
  configuration
  page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/trap-types/).

**Sex/Stage**: The sex/life stage of the abundance. Start typing to
  filter the list.

**Attached**: Available for certain method types. Check if the tick
  was attached to a host at the time of collection.

  time of collection.

**Count:** Number of specimens in the abundance. Value can be one
  of: an integer greater than zero, _Present_ or _Too Numerous to
  Count_. Values of _Present_ or _Too Numerous to Count_ are counted
  as 1 in calculations and totals reflecting those values will include
  the \>= designation.

**Abundance Table:**

**Action Buttons:**  
  ![Pencil icon](/assets/images/docs/action-button-edit.png): Edit the selected abundance. The
  abundance information will populate in the form and will no longer be
  viewable in the table. (The data is only moved locally -- if you do not
  finish editing the form or there are technical issues the abundance data
  will still be saved on the collection.)
  ![Red trash can icon](/assets/images/docs/action-button-delete.png): Delete the selected abundance.

**Total:** Total number of specimens of any sex across all abundances in the
  table.

## Pool

Optionally, a pool for arbovirus testing can be entered or linked
through the collection page. This links the pool to the collection that
the pool originated from.

### Generate Pool(s):

Use this form to enter new pool(s) linked to this collection or edit
existing pools linked to this collection.

**Pool Number**: A numeric identifier for the pool. Pool numbers
  have to be unique per agency per year. Normally you would start at 1
  and increment throughout the year but the exact numbering scheme is
  up to you. Available numbers for your agency are shown in the aside
  menu on the righthand side of the page. Open the orange Pool \#
  Availability card. You can open and close the menu using the small
  arrow tab on the far-right edge of the page.

![Collection Form Aside Menu](/assets/images/docs/aside-collection-form.png)

**Species**: The species that make up this abundance. Start typing
  to filter the list. The list of species in the dropdown can be
  adjusted through the Available Species settings on the [arthropod
  configuration
  page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/arthropod/trap-types/).

**Sex/Stage:** The sex/life stage of the ticks in this pool. Start
  typing to filter the list.

**Attached**: Available for certain method types. Check if the tick
  was attached to a host at the time of collection.

**Bloodfed**: Check if the tick was in a bloodfed condition at the
  time of collection.

**Comments:** Any accompanying comments.

**Count/Count per Pool:** The total number of specimens in this
  pool/each pool (if generating batches of more than one pool). If
  this pool has specimens from more than one site, the number of
  specimens from the primary site (**Site Code** column) will be
  determined from this value.

**\# of Pools:** The number of pools to generate. This field only
  appears when creating new pool(s).

### Link Existing Pools:

Note: When linking, the pool's **collection date**, **site** and
**trap** values will be overwritten by those of the selected collection.

A table of pools eligible to be linked to the current collection. You
can mass select all pools in the table by clicking on the checkbox in
the header column. You can also select individual pools by click on the
checkbox next to the pool. Once any pool is selected for linking, the
mass link button will appear in the header. Clicking on the mass link
button will link any pools that have been checked. You can also click on
the link button to the right of a pool to individually link a single
pool to the collection.
