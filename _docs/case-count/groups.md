A reporting group record is a combination of the group name, the counties that are a part of that group, and the year.

## Fields

- **Counties**: The county or counties that make up the group. A reporting group must have at least one county.
- **Name**: Must be unique for agency and year.
- **Year**: Year for which this group of counties applies. A county can only be in one reporting group per year.
