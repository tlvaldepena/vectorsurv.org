When finished entering the fields above, click on the _Add test species_ link to add mortality data. ![add species link]({{ site.baseur1 }}/assets/images/docs/add-species.PNG)

You are required to choose the species that was tested by typing in the species name or using the dropdown arrow to choose the species as well as whether the tested mosquitoes were from a colony or field-collected. If these were colony mosquitoes, enter the colony name and a brief description of this colony. If they were field-collected, give the generation and indicate on the map where the collections came from by typing in coordinates or using the marker tool.

The table below is automatically generated based on the **Test Defaults** settings. Enter either the number _Alive_ or _Dead_ for each time point. The other field will autofill based on the starting count. You can add rows by clicking on **Add Additional Time Series** or delete rows by clicking on the bin icon next to the time point. You can also edit time points by clicking in the text box. You can also add columns by clicking on **Add Replicate** or delete columns by clicking on the bin icon next to the replicate number.
